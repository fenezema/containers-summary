# Containers

## What is?
Containerization is an approach to software development in which an application or service, its dependencies, and its configuration (abstracted as deployment manifest files) are packaged together as a container image. 

## Why?
We often have to deal with issues like one program is working on Machine A, but simply break on Machine B. In fact, we hear this issue so often that this issue is actually a thing on internet jokes (programmers jokes most of the time). Yes, you saw that meme somewhere.

What Containerization tries to address is the issue mentioned above. By using Containerization, we set up the environment, etc so it won't matter where we deploy it, the config, the env, etc will always be the same regardless.
